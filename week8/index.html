          <li>What is Canvas</li>
          <p>With canvas, we can draw shapes and lines, 
            arcs and text, gradients and patterns. In addition,
             canvas gives us the power to manipulate pixels in images 
             and even video. </p>
          <pre><code>

  Sorry! Your browser doesnâ€™t support Canvas.

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            I was thinking about creating a Tetrix game, however, can I use canvas for that?
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            For the spread operators, is there any other coding that is similar to that?
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Something out of the topic, can Linux support videogames? I know there is a small percentage
            of people using it, and maybe that is why videogames company does not want to spend on linux.
            But why don't people use more linux? why is Linux no popular?
