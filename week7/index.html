        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Exceptions</li>
          <p>
            Exceptions are errors that produce a return value (key value) that
            can then be used by the program to deal with the error
          </p>
          <li>Strict Mode</li>
          <p>
            Strict mode, this will produce more errors since it is going to
            correct poor style codings
          </p>
          <li>Debugging in the Browser</li>
          <p>
            It is the proccess of finding out where bugs occur in the code and
            then dealing with them
          </p>
          <li>Debugging Tools</li>
          <p>
            Modern browsers also have a debugging tool that allows you to set
            breakpoints in the code to track bugs and you will be able to modify
            them. Something really useful is the tool "debugger".
          </p>

        <h3>Questions:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Is the toEqual() only use in if conditions, if not, then for what
            else it can be used? I am not really sure if this is supposoed to
            give a true or false return
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Besides using the tool "debugger" to catch errors, is there any tool
            that we can use in VSC? Something similar tot he debugger but not in
            the browser
          </li>

      <h3>Challenges</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Create a class Dog with values name, age, location and how many walks
          that the animal walked. Then create functions inside of the class, it
          has to do anything with the attributes of dog.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <pre><code>
class Dog {
    constructor(name, age, location, walks, distanceWalking) {
        this.name = name;
        this.age = age;
        this.location = location;
        this.walks = 0;
        this.distanceWalking = 0;
    }
          
    sound() {
        return `Hey, I am ${this.name}, I am form ${this.name}, WOFFFF`;
    }
          
    goingforAWalk(distance) {
        this.walks++;
        this.distanceWalking += distance;
    }
    }
